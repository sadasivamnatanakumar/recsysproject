# Health Recommendation System
Project for DS5230 where we used drug data and prescription data to create a recommender system where the diseases were the traditional "users" and drugs that helped cure them were the traditional "items", and based on various additional factors like Effectiveness, Ease of Use, Ratings among others to build recommendations.
